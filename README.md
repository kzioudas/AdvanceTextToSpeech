# AdvanceTextToSpeech
## Introduction 
The objective of this project is to develop an application that allows to edit and transform documents to
audio. The documents may be in various formats. Specifically the application supports at least Microsoft
Word (.docx) and Excel documents (.xlsx). For privacy and security reasons the contents of the
documents may be encoded with different encoding mechanisms. The target users of the application
may be people who have reading problems or visually impaired people. The application consists of a
graphical user interface, a back-end that enables the text editing process and the part that transforms
text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries. 

## Deliverables
At the end of the project the Scrum team shall deliver (via turnin)
1. The project implementation.
2. A Sprint report, according to the given Sprint report template (SprintReport-v0.doc), describing
the sprints that they performed and the "done" user stories that have been developed during
each sprint. The report shall also comprise the specification of detailed use cases, derived from
the given user stories, the detailed design of the application and CRC cards that document the
responsibilities and the collaborations between the different part of the application.
3. A DEMO video, about 15' minutes, using a screen capture tool like ActivePresenter for example.
In the demo you should illustrate that the user stories of the application are working. The demo
further demonstrate the acceptance tests that have been developed for the application.
